# A Simple Dashboard Template 

This is a much simplified version of [Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2) dashboard template.

* Removed almost all 3rd party plugins - charts, datatables
* Replaced vendor local libs with CDNs
* Removed gulp, scss entirely
* Simple nodejs setup - EJS, Express, Node. No DB yet. 

There are much more interactive elements possible with smooth animations as illustrated by ```Start Boootstrap```, but for some it could be overwhelming to start with that entire template, so I am presenting this setup. The idea is one could then refer the widgets/plugins/styles as needed from ```Start Boootstrap``` and apply here.

Also, that now I have given a minimal node backend, one could easily extend this as a full stack project already.
